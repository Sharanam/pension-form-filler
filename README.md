# Pension-form filler

- This project is a simple script that fills the pension form for you. I made it for Sardar Patel University, to make it easier for an officer to fill the form. Head of our department asked me to make it, so I did as a favor.
- It is written in Svelte which is a framework for building web apps. It is literally a single page app, so it is very fast and easy to use. Just open web page and fill the form. Export the same to PDF using the print-dialogue-box of the web browser and you are done. In other case, you can download the 'records' file which is also called 'exporting' to your computer for future use. You can also import the records file to fill the form again.
